Thorium Server: takes job requests and provides Tasks to clients
Client: registers on server and awaits task

server gets job description.
job creates Factory/Enumerable For Tasks
job gets put in priority queue
client asks server for task periodically
server gets task for client and tells client to do it. client gets associated with task.
task gets put in "in process" set/bag
client does its thing
client calls back and says Task is done
job gets signal that task is done


server needs interface for clients and seperate interface for adding jobs
on start client will register himself to server and unregister on its shutdown

on start server will read config to get additional binaries and supported job types ()
